                                <p>Since The Lottery Office launched in late 2018, The Lottery Office Charity Fund (otherwise known as ‘The Lottery Office Charitable and Community Benefits Fund’) has worked to bring about real change for Australians in need of a helping hand.

                                <p className='border-left-custom'>The Lottery Office does not operate a specific charity lottery. Rather, we operate a suite of exclusive and boutique Australian Government licensed lotteries.</p>
                                <p>Our lotteries are matched with big-time lotteries overseas, such as the US Mega Millions (when you buy a ticket in our USA Mega Lotto) and the SuperEnalotto (when you buy a ticket in our Italian Super Jackpot).<br /><br />When you buy a ticket in one of our lotteries, we purchase a ticket with the same numbers in the equivalent lottery draw overseas. If the ticket in the draw overseas wins a prize, we collect the prize, and then we pay the same amount of prize money to you. We do not charge any fees or commissions, and all winnings are free of Australian taxes.<br /><br />Each time that you purchase a ticket with us, we contribute a percentage of the ticket sale price to The Lottery Office Charity Fund. The fund periodically makes altruistic contributions to charities that may not normally get the funding that they need to operate.<br /><br />The more you play with us, the more that gets contributed to the charity fund. The more that gets contributed to the fund, the more that can be donated to charity and the more Australians benefit.<br /><br />A heartfelt thank you to all our players for your contribution to a better Australia.</p>

                                <p>As an Australian owned and operated company, our team feels a strong sense of belonging amongst our local communities. We feel a responsibility to the society in which we live. We recognise the importance of the work carried out by charities and realise how vital it is to holding the fabric of our society together. Without their efforts, a lot of people would find themselves in considerable difficulty, and we want to do our bit to help.<br /><br />Often not eligible for Government funding, many charities rely on donations as their main source of income. As a result, many cannot provide the breadth of services they wish to. That’s where we come in. We aim to alleviate as much financial pressure as we can, for as many charities as we can.<br /><br />Working closely with the charities we donate to, we get to see first-hand the positive impacts that can come with supporting those in need.<br /><br />Our customer would be thrilled to see the change they’re helping to create when they play for purpose with us!<br /><br />Aside from financial assistance, our team also participates in activities to support philanthropic organisations, such as working at the Animal Welfare League of Queensland and purchasing and delivering goods to Vinnies for them to distribute.<br /><br />We are more determined than ever to continue supporting organisations that need all the help they can get and are so important to our communities Australia-wide.</p>

                                <p>As a result we’ve donated to a diverse mixture of charities, from those that fight bushfires, to those that help injured koalas, to those that assist the homeless.<br /><br />We pledge to continue working with Aussie non-profit organisations whose purpose is to make a real difference in the lives of those who need it.</p>

                                <h4>Partnership With Royal Flying Doctor Service Takes Flight</h4>
                                <p>The Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) was given a major boost to their vital work in regional and rural Australia, with a significant donation from The Lottery Office Charity Fund.<br /><br />A total of $65,000 was committed to support this invaluable organisation by sponsoring the 2022 Outback Air Race, the largest single donation provided by The Lottery Office’s charity to date.<br /><br />The RFDS provides a crucial lifeline between rural communities and critical care services, treating 370,706 patients in 2019; however, private funding is essential as demand for the service grows. The Lottery Office CEO Jaclyn Wood said the partnership with the RFDS will help support families and communities living in isolation.<br /><br />“Our organisation has a proud history of regularly donating a portion of profits to Australian charities, having donated more than $1,000,000 to 43 different charities over the last three years; however, the RFDS partnership will be our largest,” Ms Wood said.</p>
                                <p>“The RFDS is an essential health service that our rural communities depend on, so we are honoured to be able to assist in any way we can.<br /><br />“As an Australian owned lottery provider, we want to help a great Australian legacy like RFDS continue.” The Outback Air Race is the RFDS fundraising event that occurs every three years. It is a time trial providing a navigationally challenging, self-funded flying holiday for domestic and international pilots. Starting in Darwin, Northern Territory and ending in Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, the 13-day course has nine stopovers in some of the key communities that the RFDS supports, whilst giving pilots the opportunity to view Australia from a different perspective.</p>
                                <h4>Cando Cancer Trust Benefits from Charity Lottery Office Donation</h4>
                                <p>The Coffs Coast Clarence Cando Cancer Trust has been in operation since 2009. It was started by a passionate group of retired health workers from the North Coast Cancer Institute and supported by the Coffs Coast Freemasons. They had seen first-hand the incredible toll cancer can take on sufferers and their families and decided to do what they could to ease their burdens.<br /><br />They selflessly started the not-for-profit organisation to financially support cancer sufferers enduring treatment for cancer at one of the North Coast Cancer Institute locations at Coffs Harbour, Lismore and Port Macquarie.<br /><br />They offer this support to patients who might need help with their costs of living expenses, such as food, utilities, rent, transport costs and any medical costs they might have. Since the trust was founded, it has contributed approximately $500,000 towards supporting cancer sufferers in need. So far over 1,200 patients and their families have received assistance, with an average of 120 new patients being helped each year it has been in operation.<br /><br />With COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and restrictions in place it has been difficult to carry out fundraising activities, and as a result many functions were cancelled. This had a devastating effect on the trust’s ability to generate capital and support cancer patients. Since the worst of the pandemic is now behind us, the trust plans to continue its mission with a particular focus on the indigenous population in Nambucca Valley. There is a great need to financial assistance in this region, and there are a lot of low-income cancer patient in the community.<br /><br />The Lottery Office donated $10,000 to give the initiative a boost. This provided direct support to 10 new cancer patients and their families.<br /><br />The Lottery Office’s CEO, Jaclyn Wood, says, “COVID restrictions have put a hold on fundraising activities but patients battling cancer have not stopped and the process of getting treatment is incredibly expensive,”<br /><br />“We are pleased to know that our donation will be life changing for families doing it tough and provide some relief to their situation.”</p>
                                <h4>AWLQ Works With The Lottery Office Work to Help Animals in Need</h4>
                                <p>The Lottery Office team spent a day volunteering with The Animal Welfare League of Queensland (AWLQ), at their Coombabah Rehoming Centre.<br /><br />Since 1959 the AWLQ has fought for the best interests of animals that are unable to do so for themselves.
                                    <br /><br />They provide food, shelter and medical treatment to all animals surrendered to their care and operate an adoption service to rehome them.<br /><br />A pillar of their operation is their work to de-sex as many animals as possible. Often their vets spend an entire day performing only de-sexing procedures. This is an expensive exercise. De-sexing is so important as it greatly reduces the instances of unwanted and dumped pets.<br /><br />The AWLQ receives no Government funding and relies heavily on sponsorships, donations, bequests, grants and community support. It also operates op-shops to generate much-needed funds while helping the community at the same time.<br /><br />As well as staff from The Lottery Office taking part in volunteer work, The Lottery Office Charity Fund made a donation to the AWLQ.<br /><br />As a team of pet owners and animal lovers, we are forever grateful for the invaluable work done by the AWLQ and its volunteers.
