                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>With 19 years of experience in the global lottery industry, we are the smarter choice. Real tickets, no bets.<br /><br />
                        Global Players Network Pty Ltd, the parent company of The Lottery Office, has been licensed to operate various lottery products globally since 2003. We hold both a Mail Order Lotteries Licence and an Internet Gaming Licence issued and actively regulated by the Northern Territory Government of Australia.<br /><br />
                        To ensure compliance with those regulatory requirements of our licenses we undertake an annual financial audit and an annual audit of our operational procedures, with both reports independently submitted to the Northern Territory Government. This is in addition to an auditing of customer orders against tickets purchased and the resulting draw outcomes. The entire audit process enables players, agents and suppliers to have complete confidence that business is conducted in a professional manner.</p>
