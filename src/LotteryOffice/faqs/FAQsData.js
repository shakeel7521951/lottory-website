        question:"Is this lottery betting?",
        answer:"Definitely not. Lottery betting companies operate under a Sports Betting licence and are not approved to run their own lotteries. Most lottery betting companies are headquartered overseas and rely on an insurance policy to pay out large prizes in the case that they have a major winner. They don't purchase matching tickets in the overseas lotteries. In June 2018 the Australian Federal Government passed legislation to ban Lottery Betting under the Interactive Gaming Act. The Lottery Office is a safe, licensed, reliable way for you to win from some of the biggest lotteries in the world. We are proudly Australian owned and operated and our profits stay right here in Australia."
