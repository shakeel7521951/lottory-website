If any of the matching tickets in any of the overseas draws win a prize, The Lottery Office collects the prizes and then pay you exactly the same amount of money we collected.

                                    When we noticed that a lot of our players liked to mix things up and enter the draws of more than one lottery in one transaction, we decided to make it super quick and easy with Lotto Combinations.</p>
                                <p>Lottery Combinations are not offered by most lottery providers, but at The Lottery Office, we do things a bit differently. Nowhere else do players have the chance to play all the unique licensed lotteries we offer. By wrapping them all up in one neat purchase, we make it easy for Aussies and Kiwis to have a go at winning Australia’s biggest jackpots. All of our lotteries are matched to huge international lottery draws, some with record-breaking prizes that traditional Australian lottery jackpots just can’t compete with.</p>

                                <p className='border-left-custom'>Playing a Lotto Combination is very straight forward. Once you’ve selected which Combo you’d like to play, simply click on the orange ‘Add to cart’ button.</p>
                                <img src={comboLogo} className='w-100' alt='logo' />
                                <p>This will automatically take you to the checkout page, where the tickets for all of the lotteries in your selected Combo will already be added, with random lottery numbers chosen for you in each game.</p>
                                <p>If you decide you’d like to play more than one Lotto Combo, you can simply go back to the Combo screen and click ‘Add to cart’ on another Combo. Each time you do this, it will add the selected Combo to your cart. You can even add any other lotto games you wish to your cart, such as <Link to='/syndicates'>Lotto Syndicates</Link> or Lotto Systems and purchase them all in one go.</p>
                                <h4 className='my-4'>Can I Change Lotto Combinations?</h4>
                                <p>In the Checkout screen, you can easily substitute, add or remove the games in your Combo.<br />
                                    For USA Power Lotto and USA Mega Lotto, you can add the Multiplier for $3.45 per game, which multiplies wins from non-jackpot divisions by up to 10 times for USA Power Lotto or, 5 times for USA Mega Lotto.</p>
                                <p>For La Primitiva you can add the Joker feature for $3.70, which could win you up to AUD$1.4 million.<br />You can even change the lotto numbers of each lottery ticket in a Combo if you wish. You can easily do this at the Checkout by clicking the  icon.</p>
                                <p>Once your payment has been processed we’ll email you your Order Confirmation, showing which lottery entries you’ve purchased and which lotto numbers will be played in each one. Our lottery agents will then purchase matching tickets in overseas lotteries, giving you the chance to win from famously large international jackpots.</p>

                                <p>For any prizes less than AUD$10,000, we’ll automatically pay them directly to your Lottery Office account, and from there they can be withdrawn to your nominated bank account.</p>
                                <p>In both cases you’ll be paid the same amount of prize money that we collected from the overseas draw.</p>

The USA Power Lotto ticket came out a division 3 winner!</p>
                                <p>Until we called her, she had no idea that she’d won almost $50,000, as she hadn’t yet checked the results of the three draws she entered with her Lottery Combo purchase. The anonymous winner from New South Wales was just one number from winning the entire AUD$183 million jackpot to herself! She was still ecstatic with her win and plans to put the prize money towards holidays to Antarctica and Hamilton Island.</p>

                                <p>Lotto Syndicates let you combine your ticket purchase power with other lottery players. This enables the syndicate to buy more tickets than one could on their own. By buying more tickets, the chances of winning prizes can be dramatically increased. The more shares you buy in a syndicate, the more prize money you collect if the syndicate wins a prize.</p>
                                <p>Lotto Systems let you choose more lotto numbers than is normally allowed by the rules of the matched overseas lotteries. By selecting more numbers, the chances of winning are increased compared with buying a standard lottery entry.</p>
                                <p>Multi-draw entries give players the option of pre-purchasing entry in up to 20 lotto draws in advance. This ‘set and forget’ feature is very helpful for regular players who don’t want to bother with making a new purchase for each draw.</p>
